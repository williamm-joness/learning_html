    Why's this dealer taking the piss?
</p><p>
    I've been standing here for thirty mins
</p><p>
Why's this dealer taking the piss?
</p><p>
I've been standing here, I need my things

<br>
<p>
I'm outside Pets at Home tryna find my dealer
</p><p>
He's in a Vauxhall Zafira, custom rims and a half-a-litre engine
</p><p>
But I just keep forgetting
</p><p>
I kinda wanna bell him but I've already belled him
</p><p>
He gets annoyed with how much I bell him
</p><p>
I just wanna tell him, what is the ETA?
</p><p>
I've been here pretending to be on my phone
</p><p>
I've got zero data, I'm scrolling notes
</p><p>
Pets at Home but they don't let pets in
</p><p>
I spent fifteen minutes on settings
</p><p>
I'm in Dunelm just looking at bedding
</p><p>
For a single bed that I rent in Epping
</p><p>
I'm dreading for him to come but don't wanna text him
</p>

Where's this guy, man? Let's get to it, like
</p><p>
What the fuck is he doing?
</p><p>
I see him speeding, driving fast
</p><p>
Overtaking cars like Max did Lewis
</p><p>
Should I mention dangerous driving?
</p><p>
I think I'll just remind him
</p><p>
He almost killed the guy behind him
</p><p>
But he sells things that I need buying
</p><p>
He says, "<em>Sorry to keep you waiting, I understand that it's raining</em>"
</p><p>
I said, "<em>No need to explain it, I know that your job is draining</em>"
</p><p>
He said, "<em>Nah man, I'm not complaining, I've been sat at home just gaming
</p><p>
The new God of War's amazing and I've been dabbling in</em>"
</p>
